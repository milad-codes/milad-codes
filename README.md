Full-stack AI engineer: part TypeScript, part Python, building systems that work and deliver real impact. I turn LangChain and LangGraph into production-ready AI workflows, bridging backend, frontend, and AI seamlessly.


I believe in shipping fast, learning continuously, and improving 1% every day. Clean architecture, automated testing, and building features that matter aren’t just habits—they’re a mindset.

When I’m in Next.js, pretending the Vercel AI SDK doesn’t exist is not an option — it somehow ends up in the stack.
